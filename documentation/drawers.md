# **Material-UI Drawers**

Material-UI uses drawers to present the user with the main navigation of the app. The
Drawer component acts like a physical drawer that can move out of view when it is not
being used.

## Drawer Types

There are three types (`variant`s) of `Drawer` components that you'll use in your app, as follows:

1. **Temporary**: A transient drawer that closes when an action is taken
2. **Persistent**: A drawer than can be opened and stays open until explicitly closed
3. **Permanent**: A drawer that is always visible

The Drawer component takes an `open` property, which displays the drawer when `true`. The
`variant` property determines the type of drawer to render.
